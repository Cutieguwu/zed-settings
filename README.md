Pretty self-explanitory.

These are my settings for Zed to remove all of the AI, Vibe Coding junk.

Some of these settings are subject to my personal preference of course. Themes, preferred line wrap positions, showing rules, workspace restore, font sizes, diagnostic telemetry, tab sizes, dock positions, etc.

With Zed under continued heavy development, and me losing my settings on both my coding devices once already, I figured I should have a remote git on hand.
